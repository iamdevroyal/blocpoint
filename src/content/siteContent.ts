    { q: 'What are the requirements for Tier 2 and Tier 3?', a: 'Tier 1 requires phone verification only. Tier 2 requires BVN/NIN verification for higher limits and access to remittance and loans. Tier 3 requires enhanced due diligence (business registration for agents, proof of address) to unlock stablecoin features.' },

    { q: 'How do I become an agent?', a: 'During signup or anytime after, you can activate agent mode. You\'ll need an Android device for SoftPOS features. Once activated, you can accept card payments, offer cash-out services, and earn commissions on transactions.' },

    { q: 'What happens if a transaction fails?', a: 'Our system is idempotent, meaning safe retries are built-in. If a network error occurs, the transaction is either clearly failed or pending. You can check the status instantly in your history, and reversals are processed automatically within 24 hours.' },
