    { q: 'What are the requirements for Tier 2 and Tier 3?', a: 'Tier 1 requires phone verification only. Tier 2 requires BVN/NIN verification for higher limits and access to remittance and loans. Tier 3 requires enhanced due diligence (business registration for agents, proof of address) to unlock stablecoin features.' },
