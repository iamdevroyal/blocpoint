  faq: [
    { q: 'What is BlocPoint and who is it for?', a: 'BlocPoint is a comprehensive financial operating system designed for mobile money agents, aggregators, and fintech startups. It allows you to process payments, manage cash flow, and access advanced financial services like stablecoin distribution and gift card sales from a single app.' },
    { q: 'Do I need to buy a dedicated POS machine?', a: 'No hardware required. Our SoftPOS technology turns any NFC-enabled Android smartphone into a secure payment terminal. You can accept card payments immediately after verification without waiting for device delivery.' },
    { q: 'How does the instant T+0 settlement work?', a: 'Unlike traditional banks that settle next-day, BlocPoint uses an internal ledger system. When a transaction is confirmed, your wallet balance updates instantly. You can access your funds immediately for cash-out or other transactions.' },
    { q: 'What are the requirements for Tier 2 and Tier 3?', a: 'Tier 1 requires basic ID. Tier 2 requires BVN/NIN verification for higher limits. Tier 3 is for high-volume agents and requires full business registration (CAC), proof of address, and enhanced due diligence to unlock stablecoin features.' },
    { q: 'Is the stablecoin distribution regulated?', a: 'Yes. Stablecoin access is strictly gated to Tier 3 agents who pass enhanced compliance checks. We monitor all transactions in real-time to ensure safety and regulatory adherence. It is not available for general public use without KYC.' },
    { q: 'How do you prevent fraud and chargebacks?', a: 'We use a multi-layered security approach: device integrity checks (Play Integrity), biometric authentication, real-time velocity limits, and AI-driven anomaly detection. Our ledger is immutable, providing a clear audit trail for every transaction.' },
    { q: 'Can I manage multiple sub-agents or locations?', a: 'Yes! Our dashboard allows aggregators ("Super Agents") to create sub-accounts, set commission splits, and monitor performance across multiple terminals or locations in real-time.' },
    { q: 'What happens if a transaction fails?', a: 'Our system is idempotent, meaning safe retries are built-in. If a network error occurs, the transaction is either clearly failed or pending. You can check the status instantly in your history, and reversals are processed automatically within 24 hours.' },
    { q: 'How can I contact customer support?', a: 'We offer 24/7 in-app chat support for Tier 2 and 3 agents. You can also reach us via email or our dedicated WhatsApp line. Tier 3 agents get a dedicated account manager for priority resolution.' }
