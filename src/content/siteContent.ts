    { q: 'How does the instant T+0 settlement work?', a: 'Unlike traditional banks that settle next-day, BlocPoint uses an internal ledger system. When a transaction is confirmed, your wallet balance updates instantly. You can access your funds immediately for transfers or other transactions.' },
    { q: 'What are the requirements for Tier 2 and Tier 3?', a: 'Tier 1 requires phone verification only. Tier 2 requires BVN/NIN verification for higher limits and access to remittance and loans. Tier 3 requires enhanced due diligence (business registration for agents, proof of address) to unlock stablecoin features.' },
    { q: 'Can I use BlocPoint without being an agent?', a: 'Absolutely! Most users are regular users who send transfers, buy airtime/gift cards, access remittance, and use micro-loans. Agent mode is completely optional and requires activation.' },
    { q: 'How do I become an agent?', a: 'During signup or anytime after, you can activate agent mode. You\'ll need an Android device for SoftPOS features. Once activated, you can accept card payments, offer cash-out services, and earn commissions on transactions.' },
    { q: 'Is stablecoin access available to everyone?', a: 'Stablecoin features are available to Tier 3 users (both regular users and agents) who pass enhanced compliance checks. We monitor all transactions in real-time to ensure safety and regulatory adherence.' },
    { q: 'What happens if a transaction fails?', a: 'Our system is idempotent, meaning safe retries are built-in. If a network error occurs, the transaction is either clearly failed or pending. You can check the status instantly in your history, and reversals are processed automatically within 24 hours.' },
    { q: 'How can I contact customer support?', a: 'We offer 24/7 in-app chat support for all users. Tier 2 and 3 users get priority response times. You can also reach us via email or our dedicated WhatsApp line.' }
